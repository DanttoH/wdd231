It originated from a project launched by the provincial government in 1922 to develop a tourist corridor around Plaza Independencia. In 1922, Governor Carlos Washington Lencinas inaugurated the Plaza Hotel and signed a contract for the construction of the first opera-dedicated theater in the province of Mendoza with Faustino and Mauricio da Rosa, who, at the time, managed the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires."
